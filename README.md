# WallpaperInstaller
Bing Desktop Wallpaper replacement without all the Bing nonsense.
Output folder contains a simple .exe file that bundles everything.

Uses the daily Bing Wallpaper.
Keeps an archive of images as you use it, so that it can randomly select an image from that if it can't get to bing.com on update.
Installer asks for archive size limit, so it doesn't take up a ton of space if you are short.
Defaults to 4k images, but will get HD if 4k not available. (can also select HD as default instead)
All options are selectable with Config.ini file, or with the installer.
